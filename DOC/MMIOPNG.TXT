MMIOPNG 0.7 is my first attempt to create an extension to OS/2 Warp 
Multimedia Subsystem, in this version only reading PNG files is supported.

It is mostly based on LibPNG 1.0 beta 2 - version 0.85
by Guy Eric Schalnat, Group 42, Inc.
And Zlib version 0.95 by Jean-Ioup Gailly and Mark Adler.

arising from the use of this software.

I will appreciate any comment and suggestion.
